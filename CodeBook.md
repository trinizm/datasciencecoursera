# Code Book

## Subject and Activity

 - `subject_id`: integer, range 1:30
 - `activity_name`: character, values:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING

## Measures:

 - All variables are the mean (prefix 'Mean') of a measurement for each subject and activity.
 - All are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
 - The convention for variable names is:
  - `Mean{TimeOrFrequencyOrangle}{measurement}{.MeanOrStdDev}{.X,Y,Z}` where:
  - 'Time' denotes 'time domain'
  - 'Frequency' denotes 'frequency domain'
  - 'Angle' denotes 'angular velocity'
  - 'Acc' denotes 'accelaration'
  - 'Gyro' denotes ' gyroscope'
  - 'Mag' denotes 'magnitude'
  - 'StdDev' denotes 'standard deviation'
  - 'X,Y,Z' denotes 'triaxial along which the measurement was taken'
